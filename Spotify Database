# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

--Exploring Spotify data

SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

--What are the 20 most popular songs/artists?

SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
LIMIT 20;

--What is the average popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track
SELECT
artist_name
,track_name
,avg(popularity)
,avg(danceability)
,avg(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

--What are all the measures of songs with popularity 90 or above?

SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE popularity >= 90;

--Does tempo correlate with popularity? Query tempo, artist track, popularity descending by tempo--somewhat, higher tempo for the most part seems to be higher popularity
SELECT id, tempo, artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY tempo desc;

--Does energy or danceablity affect popularity? not necessarily (#1 song is 4 from the bottom for energy and 9 from the bottom for danceability;

SELECT id, artist_name, track_name, popularity, danceability, energy
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY energy desc;

SELECT id, artist_name, track_name, popularity, danceability, energy
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY danceability desc;

--What is the average danceability by artist?

SELECT DISTINCT artist_name, COUNT(track_name), danceability/COUNT(track_name)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name;

--What artist released the longest song? Farruko 287120
SELECT artist_name, MAX(duration_ms)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

--What is the average danceablilty for the 10 most popular songs? 0.68572
SELECT AVG(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity
LIMIT 10;
